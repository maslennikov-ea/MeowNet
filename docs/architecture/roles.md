🎯 Role Evolution in the System

Initial Participation Level:

- Initiator - can create tasks
- Solver - can provide solutions

With Experience Accumulation:

- Synthesizer - after demonstrating generalization ability
- Facilitator - after successful participation in several cells

Through Community Trust:

- Curator - by community recommendation or selection
- Administrator - technical role, requires special skills

💡 Role Model Principles

1. Role Multiplicity

Each user can perform different roles in different contexts:

- Be Initiator in professional area
- Act as Solver in adjacent areas
- Become Facilitator for topics with deep knowledge

2. Emergence

Roles arise naturally from interactions:

- Synthesizers emerge when working with complex tasks
- Facilitators are identified during group work
- Curators form from active and responsible participants

3. Contextuality

Role effectiveness depends on context:

- Specialist can be Solver in narrow area but Initiator in adjacent one
- Experienced Facilitator in technical topics can be beginner in creative ones

4. Learning Through Participation

Competence development occurs through:

- Observation of experienced participants' work
- Gradual complexity increase in accepted roles
- Receiving community feedback

🔧 Role Model Integration with Technical Architecture

User Profile with Roles:

```yaml
UserProfile:
  id: UUID
  base_roles: List[Role]           # Initiator, Solver
  emergent_roles: List[Role]       # Facilitator, Synthesizer
  trust_roles: List[Role]          # Curator, Administrator
  
  role_effectiveness:
    - role: Role
      domains: List[String]        # Effectiveness areas
      confidence: Float            # System confidence
      community_rating: Float      # Community rating
  
  learning_path:
    - current_focus: Role
      target_roles: List[Role]
      development_activities: List[Activity]
```

Role-Based Recommendation System:

```python
def recommend_participants_for_cell(task, required_roles):
    participants = []
    
    for role in required_roles:
        # Search for users effective in this role
        # for specific subject area
        candidates = find_users_by_role_and_domain(
            role=role,
            domain=task.categories,
            min_confidence=0.7
        )
        participants.extend(candidates[:2])  # Top-2 candidates
    
    return participants
```

This role-based approach transforms meowNet from a simple technical platform into a living social system where every participant finds their place and contributes according to their abilities and interests, while the system architecture supports natural emergence of roles and competencies.
