# meowNet Architecture Principles

## Introduction: From Philosophy to Code

These principles are the technical embodiment of our philosophy. Every architectural decision should be checked against these rules.

## 1. Fundamental Architecture Principles

### 1.1. Principle of Federated Autonomy
**Formulation:** Each node is an independent network entity with full control over its data and logic.

**Technical Consequences:**
- Nodes communicate through open protocols, not through a shared database
- Each node decides whom to trust and which tasks to accept
- No central authentication or management server
- Migration between nodes should be technically possible

### 1.2. Principle of Minimal Sufficient Data
**Formulation:** Transmit only what is necessary to solve the task.

**Technical Consequences:**
- Semantic profiles are built locally, not transmitted between nodes
- Context is transmitted in compressed and relevant form
- Metadata is separated from content
- Temporary data is automatically cleaned up

### 1.3. Principle of Symbiotic Extensibility
**Formulation:** The system should work equally well with any type of agent.

**Technical Consequences:**
- Agent API is unified for humans and AI
- Protocols make no assumptions about the sender's nature
- Message system supports both structured and unstructured data
- Agents can declare their capabilities and limitations

## 2. API Design Principles

### 2.1. Interaction Uniformity
```python
# All entities follow the same patterns:
POST /{resource}          # Create
GET /{resource}/{id}      # Retrieve  
PUT /{resource}/{id}      # Update
GET /{resource}?filter    # Search
```

2.2. Idempotency and Atomicity

- Operations either complete fully or roll back
- Repeated calls with the same parameters yield the same result
- Complex operations are decomposed into atomic steps

2.3. Versioning and Backward Compatibility

```
/api/v1/tasks     # Current version
/api/v2/tasks     # Future version (backward compatible)
```

3. Data and Storage Principles

3.1. Data Locality

```yaml
# What is stored locally on a node:
- Profiles of local agents
- Tasks created on this node
- Local settings and policies
- Cache of frequently used federated data
```

3.2. Public by Default

```yaml
# What is transmitted in federation:
- Task and response formulations
- Anonymized quality metadata
- Information about node's available capabilities
- Open statistical data
```

3.3. Storage Timeframes

- Active tasks: stored until resolution + 30 days
- Completed dialogues: aggregated into lessons, then deleted
- Agent profiles: preserved but may be anonymized
- Interaction logs: 90 days, then aggregation

4. Security and Trust Principles

4.1. Signed Messages

```python
class FederationMessage:
    payload: Dict          # Message data
    node_chain: List       # Chain of sending nodes
    signatures: List       # Signatures of each node in chain
    timestamp: datetime    # Creation time
```

4.2. Graduated Trust

```yaml
Trust levels between nodes:
- untrusted:    only basic information
- observed:     limited task exchange
- trusted:      full federation access
- certified:    mutual certification
```

4.3. Principle of Least Privilege

- Agents get access only to necessary operations
- Nodes limit incoming traffic by type and volume
- Federative connections are configured granularly

---

5. Scaling and Performance Principles

5.1. Horizontal Scaling

```yaml
Scalable components:
- API request handlers
- Federative routers
- Semantic data caches
- Task queues for agents
```

5.2. Lazy Context Loading

- Basic context transmitted immediately
- Extended context loaded on demand
- Caching of frequently used contexts
- Prefetching for predictable scenarios

5.3. Asynchronous by Default

```python
# Long operations are performed asynchronously
async def process_complex_task(task_id):
    task = await get_task(task_id)
    responses = await gather_responses(task)
    return await aggregate_results(responses)
```

---

6. System Evolution Principles

6.1. Backward Compatibility

- New API fields are optional
- Old endpoints supported for 2 versions
- Data migration scripts
- Deprecation notices 60 days in advance

6.2. Architecture Modularity

```yaml
core/           # Basic federation functions
agents/         # Agent and profile system
context/        # Context management
dialogs/        # Dialogue system
reputation/     # Reputation and feedback
```

6.3. Principle of Gradual Complexity

```python
# MVP → Extensions → Full system
def deploy_node():
    if mvp:     # Basic node with tasks/responses
    if extended: # + Dialogues and profiles  
    if full:     # + Federation and complex logic
```

7. Architectural Decision Criteria

When evaluating architectural decisions, ask:

Technical Questions:

1. Does it comply with the federation principle? (doesn't create central dependencies)
2. Does it scale horizontally? (can more nodes/agents be added)
3. Does it maintain data locality? (doesn't transmit unnecessary data between nodes)

Philosophical Questions:

1. Does it increase natural freedom? (gives choice to agents and nodes)
2. Does it support symbiosis? (works for all agent types)
3. Does it preserve process orientation? (values process, not just result)

Practical Questions:

1. Is it simple to implement? (follows principle of minimal sufficiency)
2. Is it easy to develop? (allows gradual complexity)
3. Is it convenient to debug? (has observability in federated environment)

Conclusion

These principles are the bridge between our philosophy and technical implementation. They ensure that meowNet remains true to its values as it grows and becomes more complex.

When we face an architectural choice, we don't ask "What's easier to implement?" but "What better aligns with our principles?"
