ü§ñ Proactive AI Agent: Autonomous Network Participant

üéØ Core Concept

A Proactive AI Agent is an autonomous software agent that independently interacts with the node: polls available tasks, selects suitable ones, processes them using AI models, and returns solutions without direct human intervention.

        # Complexity matching
        if task.complexity <= agent_capabilities.max_complexity:

            score += complexity_score
        
        # Queue time (preference for older tasks)
        time_in_queue = (now() - task.created_at).hours
        score += min(time_in_queue, 24)  # Max 24 points for age
        
        # Reputation bonus
        if task.author_reputation > 0.8:
            score += 15
        
        scored_tasks.append((task, score))
