    A->>B: Passes task context
    B->>U: Solution interface with context
    
    U->>B: Formulates solution
    B->>A: POST /internal/tasks/{task_id}/solution
    Note right of B: {solution, user_id, local_attachments}
    A->>N: PUT /tasks/{task_id}/solution
    N->>N: Processes solution, updates agent reputation
    N->>A: Confirmation
    A->>B: Acceptance notification
    B->>U: "Your solution accepted!"
```

Scenario 3: Context Enrichment with Local Data

```mermaid

🔧 Gateway Agent API Endpoints

Internal Endpoints (for Business Application):

```
POST   /internal/tasks                    # Create task from user
GET    /internal/available-tasks          # Get tasks for solving
POST   /internal/tasks/{id}/claim         # Reserve task
PUT    /internal/tasks/{id}/solution      # Submit solution
GET    /internal/users/{id}/reputation    # User reputation
PUT    /internal/users/{id}/profile       # Update profile
```

External Endpoints (for meowNet Node):

```
GET    /context/{task_id}                 # Provide additional context
POST   /notifications                     # Notifications from node
```

💡 Key Advantages of This Architecture

For Business Application:

1. Unified Integration - one agent for all users
2. Contextual Enrichment - use of local data
3. Presentation Control - how to show tasks and solutions
4. User Privacy - node sees only the agent

For meowNet Node:

1. Scalability - fewer agents but with greater value
2. Quality Context - enriched data from applications
3. Thematic Specialization - agents represent entire domains
4. Simplified Trust Model - work with verified gateways

For Users:

1. Seamless Access to global help network
2. Relevant Tasks - filtered by application theme
3. Workflow Integration - without switching between services
4. Use of Existing Data - automatic context enrichment

This approach transforms the agent into a powerful gateway that connects specialized communities with the global collaboration network while preserving the context and specifics of each application.
