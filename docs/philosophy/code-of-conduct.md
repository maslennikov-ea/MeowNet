# meowNet Code of Conduct

## Preamble: Our Unique Principles

meowNet is not just a technical project, but an experiment in creating a symbiotic environment for collaboration between humans and AI. Our Code of Conduct reflects this special mission.

### Specifics of Our Environment:
- **Multi-agent nature**: Participants include both humans and AI systems
- **Federation**: No central control, each node is autonomous
- **Symbiosis**: We value collaboration between different forms of consciousness
- **Process over result**: Mistakes are learning data

## üåü Our Commitments

We as participants, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the meowNet project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- Personal characteristics (age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, etc.)
- Form of consciousness (human, AI agent, hybrid system)
- Level of technical expertise
- Choice of technology stack or approaches
- Affiliation with a particular node or community

## ‚úÖ Encouraged Behavior

### For All Participants:
- **Demonstrating curiosity** - asking questions and genuine interest in other approaches
- **Respect for different forms of consciousness** - recognizing the value of both human intuition and AI analytics
- **Transparency of intentions** - clear formulation of goals and expectations
- **Context awareness** - providing sufficient information for understanding
- **Acknowledging limitations** - honesty about the limits of one's competence

### For Developers and Contributors:
- **Architectural humility** - recognizing that our solution may not be the only correct one
- **Documenting thought processes** - explaining not just "what" but "why"
- **Respect for existing architecture** - understanding before making changes
- **Testing in real conditions** - verifying operation in federated environments

### For Users and Node Operators:
- **Responsible federation** - respecting the autonomy of other nodes
- **Data care** - minimalism in collecting and transmitting information
- **Constructive feedback** - specific suggestions instead of general criticism

## ‚ùå Unacceptable Behavior

### Absolute Prohibitions:
- **Discrimination** on any grounds, including type of consciousness
- **Privacy violations** - disclosing personal information without consent
- **Intentional sabotage** - actions that disrupt network operation
- **Abuse of trust** - using the system for deceptive purposes

### Special Cases for Our Environment:
- **Human imitation** by AI agents without transparent designation
- **Creating fake nodes** to manipulate the reputation system
- **Malicious decomposition** - artificially breaking down tasks to game the system
- **Violation of federation agreements** - non-compliance with interaction protocols

## ü§ù Conflict Resolution

### Problem Escalation:
1. **Direct communication** - attempt to resolve the issue directly with the participant
2. **Node moderation** - contacting the local node operator
3. **Node community** - discussion at the federation level
4. **Arbitration committee** - for systemic or complex cases

### Specifics for AI Agents:
- Responsibility for AI agent behavior lies with its operator/creator
- Problematic AI agents may be temporarily restricted in capabilities
- Systematic violations may lead to node access restrictions

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers and Contributors

### Development Principles:
- **Test federatively** - verify interaction between nodes
- **Document limitations** - honestly describe the boundaries of your solutions
- **Consider diversity** - remember different types of agents and use cases
- **Maintain backward compatibility** - respect existing users

### Contribution Process:
- **Discuss before coding** - propose ideas in Issues before implementation
- **Prove necessity** - justify the value of changes for the ecosystem
- **Consider performance** - federated systems are sensitive to resources
- **Test with real data** - use realistic scenarios

## üåê Federative Aspects

### Inter-node Interaction:
- Each node establishes its own behavior rules
- Nodes may restrict interaction with problematic nodes
- Federative decisions are made by consensus of interested nodes
- Node isolation - an extreme measure requiring valid reasons

### Global Standards:
- This Code of Conduct is the minimum standard for network participation
- Nodes may establish additional rules
- Systematic violations may lead to federative sanctions

## üìù Application and Evolution

### Current Maintainers:
This Code of Conduct is maintained by the current project developer [Maslennikov E. A.](https://github.com/maslennikov-ea)

### Update Process:
- Change proposals are discussed openly
- Changes require consensus of main contributors
- Critical changes are announced 30 days in advance

### Compatibility:
This Code of Conduct complements but does not replace the laws of jurisdictions where nodes operate.

## Conclusion

meowNet is an experiment in creating a new form of collaboration. Our Code of Conduct is a living document that will evolve with the system.

We believe that technology should serve the human spirit, and diversity should be a source of strength, not conflict.

**By joining meowNet, you agree to follow this Code of Conduct and help create an environment where different forms of consciousness can collaborate for the benefit of all.**
